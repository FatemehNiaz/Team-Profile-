# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Task

To build an application that takes in information about employees who work on a software engineering team using Node.js command-line and then generates an HTML webpage that shows summaries for each person. 


Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.


## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I need you to generate a webpage that displays my team members basic info
SO THAT I can find their emails and GitHub profiles quickly and easiy
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that you can enter the user input
WHEN I want to access and check my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that shows team information based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile will be open in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am taken where I need to enter the team manager’s name, the employee ID, their email address, and office number
WHEN I enter these input:  the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am taken to a menu with the option to be able to add an an intern or an engineer or to finish building my team by put the arrow on done
WHEN I selechoose the engineer option
THEN I should enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I can choose maybe the intern option this time
THEN I should enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I will be taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, I select Done, and the HTML is generated
```

## Mock-Up
